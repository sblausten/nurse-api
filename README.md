# Right Nurse Tech Test

Thanks for taking the time to attempt the Right Nurse tech test!

We have tried to design a test that reflects the kind of work we are doing at Right Nurse. Although the test is simplistic, it requires the same skills as our real day-to-day work.

The test is not timed but we recommend that you spend no more than 3 hours on it.

## Requirements

Your task is build API endpoints for a nurse resource.

Your endpoints should allow the client to perform the following:
* View all nurses in the system
* View a single nurse object
* Create a single nurse object
* Update a single nurse object
* Delete a single nurse object

Your endpoints should include **all** the fields on the nurse table.

`verified` and `sign_in_count` fields should not be updatable via the API.

## Additional Notes

The initial Rails application has already been built. Along with some database tables and models. You shouldn't need to modify the database or models.

If you are invited to a face-to-face interview, you will be required to explain your code.
